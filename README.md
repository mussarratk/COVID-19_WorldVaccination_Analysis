# Python_COVID-19_WorldVaccination_Analysis
## Visualizing the Worldwide Immunization Efforts

The aim of this project was to analyze and provide insights on the global vaccination rollout. The goal was to develop a dashboard with daily metrics that capture the speed and scale of the vaccination program.

To achieve this, I utilized Tableau, a popular and robust data visualization software. After evaluating multiple datasets, I selected the Our World in Data COVID vaccination dataset. This dataset is regularly updated and provides the most recent official numbers from governments and health ministries worldwide.

The dashboard includes several key metrics:

* Share of the population that has been partly, fully, and not vaccinated.
* Continent and country-wise vaccination.
* Vaccine doses administered.
* Correlation between GDP and vaccination program performance.

The dashboard offers the flexibility to filter data by date, country, and continent. Additionally, it incorporates visually appealing map charts to enhance the user experience.
